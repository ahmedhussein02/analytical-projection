using LAB colorr space over RGB since it is more accurate

we use homography matrix/transformation to map players from frames to the tactical map

homography transformation/matrix needs at least 4 keypoints in each frame to work

we can achieve 100% accuracy of pov shift if we use only 4 keypoints especially if these keypoints are proximate of each other.. however using more keypoints or in other words covering a wider area will decrease the accuracy due to camera warp or the points are not in one 3d planar

tactical map pov shift was not smooth due to the frame by frame update of the homography matrix.. the issue is solved by applying a condition where it only updates if the current frame's common keypoints exceed a specified distance from the last frame's keypoints
